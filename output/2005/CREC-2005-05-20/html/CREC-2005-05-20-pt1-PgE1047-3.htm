                      BIKE TARIFF SUSPENSION BILLS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. EARL BLUMENAUER

                               of oregon

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing seven bills that 
will waive tariffs for specialty bike parts not produced domestically.
  The bicycle industry is an important part of our economy. There are 
over 6,000 bicycle shops and 2,000 companies that deal with bicycle 
manufacturing with tens of thousands of employees. These tariff waivers 
will reduce costs for the bicycle industry and will allow the savings 
to be passed onto the more than 57 million adult bicyclists across the 
country.
  Similar bike components that are not produced in the United States 
are already exempt from tariffs in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. 
Without a domestic producer of compatible components, bike companies 
should not be required to pay duties. This legislation will level the 
playing field for the industry which provides one of the cleanest, 
healthiest, most efficient, and environmentally friendly modes of 
transportation that exists.
