               TRIBUTE TO THE LATE WARREN ``CLIP'' SMITH

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. THOMAS M. REYNOLDS

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to 
pay tribute to the late Warren ``Clip'' Smith, a veteran broadcast 
personality and civic leader who touched the lives of thousands through 
his career and work in the Western New York community. The life-long 
Lockport resident is fondly remembered by thousands following his 
unexpected passing on August 21, 2004.
  From the 1960s on, the ``Clipper,'' as he was commonly referred, was 
a respected name in the radio and television industry, earning a 
reputation for his strong opinions, as well as his quick wit and one-
liner quips. His career began as Operations Manager and Director of 
News and Sports for WUSJ Radio, now known as WLVL in Lockport. He went 
on to serve as anchor, reporter and sports play-by-play announcer with 
WKBW-TV Channel 7 in Buffalo, New York, from 1971 to 1989, later 
working as a reporter and talk show host with WGR Radio in Buffalo from 
1991 to 1995. Clip was also a widely recognized commentator and 
reporter with WBEN Radio in Buffalo. Finally, from 1990 until the time 
of his death, Clip served as anchor, reporter and in public relations 
for the Empire Sports Network in Buffalo.
  The multi-talented Clipper also was a musician. He was a member of 
the Lockport Federation of Musicians and a professional member of the 
American Federation of Musicians; Clip was a concert soloist on the 
trombone, euphonium, tuba and string bass.
  But above all else, Clip will be remembered for the active civic role 
he played, always ready to take up the citizens' cause on a variety of 
issues. Clip served on a local board of education from 2003-2004, was 
active with Lockport Rotary Club, Literacy Volunteers, Buffalo City 
Mission, New York State Recycling Congress, and the Niagara County 
Republican Committee. He also was a member of several local unions.
  Western New Yorkers will always remember Clip as a respected 
community leader and a dear friend.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that this Congress join me in honoring the late 
Warren ``Clip'' Smith, and recognize his years of service to the 
community and broadcast industry.
