LETTER TO SALVADORAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. RENE ANTONIO LEON RODRIGUEZ

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, on April 29, 2002, Rep. Raul Grijalva and 
I sent the following letter to Salvadoran Ambassador to the United 
States, Rene Antonio Leon Rodriguez regarding police brutality against 
Salvadoran government officials:

       Dear Ambassador Leon: It has just been brought to our 
     attention that Salvadoran diputados Dr. Salvador Arias and 
     Zoila Quijada were victims of police brutality yesterday 
     while defending protesters of the Social Security Doctors 
     Union (SIMETRISSS).
       The protesters were members of the doctors union who were 
     upset about the unjust decision to deport Dr. Pedro Bachon 
     Rodriguez, an Ecuadorian doctor and adviser to the doctors 
     union who has been a legal resident of El Salvador for the 
     past 8 years.

     Diputado Arias and Quijada stepped in to mediate between the 
     doctors union and the police an to defend the protesters, and 
     the police responded by beating them too. They identified 
     themselves to the police as members of the Legislative 
     Assembly, but the police continued to beat them. Fortunately 
     their bodyguards stepped in to protect them before the were 
     terribly injured.
       We disapprove of in the strongest terms the use of police 
     violence against the government officials. This 
     unconscionable violation of human rights and democracy 
     threatens the 1992 Peace Accords and could lead to grave 
     consequences. Furthermore, we strongly disapprove of the 
     police violence against protesters. This violence has been 
     increasing recently with anti-CAFTA protests in El Salvador. 
     The Salvadoran Interior Minister endorsed the police violence 
     against protesters that occurred on April 14 and wrongfully 
     called the protesters ``terrorists.''
       This is not acceptable. This will not go unnoticed by the 
     United States and by international human rights movements. Be 
     assured that, we will pursue an investigation into this 
     matter to the fullest.

  On May 3, 2005, Ambassador Leon sent the following reply:

       Dear Representative Kucinich: We acknowledge receipt of 
     your letter dated April 29, 2005 in which you express your 
     concern on the apparent use of police force against two 
     congresspeople of the Salvadoran Legislative Assembly, Dr. 
     Salvador Arias and Dr. Zoila Quijada, while seemingly 
     defending members of the Social Security Doctors Union 
     (SIMETRISSS).
       To that respect, we have proceeded to send your letter to 
     the pertinent authorities in El Salvador who are already 
     aware of your preoccupation and will soon deliver you their 
     response.
       Please accept Mr. Representative Kucinich the assurances of 
     our consideration and esteem.

                          ____________________
