                     TRIBUTE TO SIM EDWARDS STOKES

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this 
opportunity to tell my colleagues about a proud American and a beloved 
Dallas resident: Sim Edward Stokes. As family and friends fondly know 
him as ``Simi,'' I would like to take a moment to acknowledge his 
energy and vitality to every undertaking. He is the king of networking, 
and his unabashed enthusiasm is irresistibly infectious. I do not doubt 
for a second that, he brings his skills from the NFL Champion Dallas 
Cowboys where he was part of the 1967-1968 team.
  Anyone who has had the pleasure of working with Simi is immediately 
struck by his passion for education, and his belief that all children 
should be able to receive a top notch education, regardless of their 
economic standing. He is Vice Chair of the St. Paul Endowment Fund 
which provides grants for special programs for children, youth and 
adults. This fund enables them to grow in their understanding of the 
Christian faith and have the opportunity to receive scholarships and 
grants for the purpose of attending college and seminary to prepare for 
a church related vocation, and for funding for church camping, retreats 
and leadership conferences.
  Mention his family and you'll see Simi burst with pride. He is 
married to the lovely Elnora Jean Stokes. He is also the father of four 
young lads, and one ``princess'' whom is a U.S. Army Major at the 
Pentagon.
  Simi holds a MBA from University of Dallas. He has been member of 
Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity since 1965. He was also honorably discharged 
from the Texas National Guard in 1968.
  We, in Dallas, are lucky that Simi left Alabama and adopted Dallas as 
his home and, in time, adopted each of us and shared his great love for 
his fellow man. I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to 
join me in extending my appreciation to Simi for over three decades of 
service to the people of Texas.
