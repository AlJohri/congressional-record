                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the 64th anniversary 
of the Battle of Crete by introducing this House Resolution which 
recognizes and appreciates the historical significance of the people of 
Crete during World War II.

[[Page E1051]]

  This was a historic event with direct significance to the Allies' 
victory of World War II. On May 20, 1941, thousands of German 
paratroopers and gliders began landing on Crete. Both the Allies and 
Nazis wanted Crete because of its strategic location. At that time the 
British controlled the island. It was a very strong point on the 
lifeline to India and protected both Palestine and Egypt.
  The Nazi invasion force included the elite German paratroopers and 
glider troops. Hitler felt this was to be an easy victory, yet he is 
quoted to have said shortly after the invasion, ``France fell in 8 
days. Why is Crete free?''
  The invasion of Crete took eleven days. It resulted in more than 
6,000 German troopers listed as killed, wounded, or missing in action. 
The losses to the elite 7th parachute division were felt so hard by the 
German Military that it signified the end of large-scale airborne 
operations.
  This valiant fight by the Cretan people began in the first hour of 
the Nazi airborne invasion, in contrast to the European underground 
movements that took a year or more after being invaded to begin.
  Young boys, old men and women displayed breathtaking bravery in 
defending their Crete. German soldiers never got used to Cretan women 
fighting them. They would tear the dress from the shoulders of 
suspected women to find bruises from the recoil of the rifle. The 
penalty was death.
  On July 28, 1941, The Times (London) reported that ``five hundred 
Cretan women have been deported to Germany for taking part in the 
defense of their native island.''
  Another surprise for the German soldiers who invaded Crete was the 
heroic resistance of the clergy. A priest leading his parishioners into 
battle was not what the Germans anticipated. At Paleochora, Father 
Stylianos Frantzeskis, hearing of the German airborne invasion, rushed 
to his church, sounded the bell, took his rifle and marched his 
volunteers toward Maleme to write history.
  This struggle became an example for all Europe to follow in defying 
German occupation and aggression.
  The price paid by the Cretans for their valiant resistance to Nazi 
forces was high. Thousands of civilians died from random executions, 
starvation, and imprisonment. The Germans burned and destroyed entire 
communities as a reprisal for the Cretan resistance movement. Yet this 
resistance lasted for four years.
  The Battle of Crete changed the final outcome of World War II, and 
significantly contributed in delaying Hitler's plan to invade Russia. 
The invasion was delayed from April to June of 1941.
  The 2-month delay in the invasion made Hitler's forces face the 
Russian winter.
  The Russian snowstorms and the sub zero temperatures eventually 
stalled the Nazi invasion before they could take Moscow or Leningrad. 
This was the beginning of the downfall of the Nazi reign of terror.
  This significant battle and the heroic drive of the Cretan people 
must always be remembered and honored. Democracy came from Greece, and 
the Cretan heroes exemplified the courage it takes to preserve it.
  Today, the courage and fortitude of the Cretan people are seen in the 
members of the United Cretan Associations of New York which are located 
in Astoria, Queens.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring the Cretans in the United 
States, Greece, and the diaspora.
