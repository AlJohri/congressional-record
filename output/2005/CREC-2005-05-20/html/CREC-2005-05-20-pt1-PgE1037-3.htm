             IN HONOR OF ST. ADALBERT ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor St. Adalbert Roman 
Catholic Church, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. 
To begin the year-long celebration, the parish will hold its opening 
ceremony event on May 21, 2005, in Elizabeth, New Jersey.
  Founded in 1905, St. Adalbert was developed from the hopes and dreams 
of Polish immigrants in the Elizabeth area. Longing for a place of 
worship that would serve the needs of Polish-speaking Americans, the 
original members each contributed their own money to purchase land and 
construct the church. As it prepares for its centennial celebration, we 
look back and honor the innumerable contributions that St. Adalbert has 
made to the Elizabeth community. Though the building was constructed in 
just one year, this parish has spent the last century providing strong 
spiritual support for its members.
  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring St. Adalbert Roman 
Catholic Church for 100 years of religious commitment and excellence in 
serving the people of Elizabeth, New Jersey.
