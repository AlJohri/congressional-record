                           HON. CHET EDWARDS

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a great Army officer 
and soldier, Colonel Alan R. Lynn, and to thank him for his 
contributions to the Army and the country. On Thursday, June 2, 2005, 
Colonel Lynn will relinquish command of the Army's 3rd Signal Brigade 
which is stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, for reassignment to the Army 
Staff in Washington, DC.
  Colonel Lynn began his military career in 1979 following his 
graduation from the University of Pennsylvania at California, 
Pennsylvania. Commissioned as an Air Defense Artillery officer from 
ROTC he completed several successful assignments in the Air Defense 
Artillery before he transferred to the U.S. Army Signal Corps. During 
Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm he served as the 1st Brigade 
Signal Officer with the fabled 101st Airborne Division. In 1997, he 
commanded the 13th Signal Battalion, 1st Cavalry Division both at Fort 
Hood, Texas and in Bosnia with Task Force Eagle. Colonel Lynn took 
command of the 3rd Signal Brigade, Fort Hood, Texas, on June 13, 2002. 
He deployed the Brigade to 66 separate locations throughout Iraq in 
January, 2004 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom creating the 
largest tactical communications network in Army history. For over a 
decade Alan has been tested in conflict and hardened in battle to 
become one of the Army's finest and most experienced Signal Corps 
commanders.
  Alan is a consummate professional whose performance personifies those 
traits of courage, competency, and commitment that our Nation has come 
to expect from its Army officers. It is with sadness that we wish him 
Godspeed and good luck as he leaves Fort Hood for his new assignment.

  Alan's career has reflected his deep commitment to our Nation, and 
has been characterized by dedicated, selfless service, love for 
soldiers and their families and a commitment to excellence. I ask 
Members to join me in offering our heartfelt appreciation for a job 
well done and best wishes for continued success to a great soldier and 
friend--Colonel Alan R. Lynn.
