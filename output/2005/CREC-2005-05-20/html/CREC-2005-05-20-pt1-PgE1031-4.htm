exceptional individual, Mr. Thomas Infusino. Thomas was honored at the 
Wakefern Food Corporation's annual meeting on Thursday, May 19, 2005.
  Over the past thirty-four years, Thomas Infusino has worked 
tirelessly on behalf of his investors, employees, and clients. His 
commitment to his business, the food distribution industry, and the 
community at large has left an indelible mark on the lives of many, 
demonstrating the difference one dedicated person can make. It is only 
fitting that we honor Thomas Infusino, in this, the permanent record of 
the greatest freely elected body on Earth.
  Thomas served in the United States military during World War II, 
primarily stationed in Italy and Africa. Upon his return he quickly 
became a part of the Northern New Jersey community and has raised a 
family in our wonderful state. Thomas has truly made a name for himself 
as an innovative entrepreneur with a propensity for giving back to the 
community.
  Tom has been chairman and CEO of Wakefern Food Corporation, a 
retailer-owned cooperative of the wholesale merchandising and 
distribution arm for ShopRite supermarkets, since 1971. He is also the 
owner and president of the Nutley Park ShopRite located in Nutley, NJ.
  Mr. Infusino's philanthropic spirit has been recognized by an array 
of organizations. Tom was honored by the Cooley's Anemia Foundation and 
subsequently given the Lifeline Award fur his efforts. Additionally, 
Tom continues to work closely with the Lautenberg Center for General 
and Tumor Immunology, which sponsors the annual Thomas Infusino Prize. 
He also serves on the Board of Governors for the National Conference 
for Community and Justice as well as retaining a seat on the Board of 
Directors of the New Jersey Food Council.
  The job of a United States Congressman involves so much that is 
rewarding, yet nothing compares to learning about and recognizing the 
efforts of individuals like Thomas Infusino.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues, the members of the 
Infusino family, and myself in recognizing Thomas Infusino for his 
outstanding service.
