  Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Salvatore J. 
Chilia, as the State of Israel Bonds is honoring his decades-long 
commitment and work in supporting and protecting the American worker.
  Mr. Chilia began work as an electrician with an apprenticeship in 
1967. His service to workers began in 1977, when he was elected as an 
officer of Local 38's examining board Mr. Chilia served seventeen years 
on the executive board, including nine years as chairman. In 1989, he 
was elected president of Local 38, working on behalf of 2,200 active 
members and 850 retirees. Throughout his tenure as board member, 
president and chairman, Mr. Chilia maintained an unwavering

focus on the rights and welfare of workers and their families. His 
ascension through the union ranks is reflected by the numerous 
successes for members, including the protection and promotion of 
workers' safety, compensation, benefits and pensions.
  Mr. Chilia created strong bonds of trust and respect throughout the 
union community and was elected to the office of Business Manager of 
the Cleveland Electrical JATC. His expertise and commitment has been 
sought out nationally as well. In 2001, Mr. Chilia was elected as a 
member of the 36th Annual IBEW International Convention's executive 
council, representing members in the areas of construction, 
manufacturing, broadcasting, utilities, maintenance and railroad 
workers. Beyond his service to workers, Mr. Chilia has a deep and 
abiding dedication to his family and community. Mr. Chilia and his 
wife, Arlene, maintain an unbreakable focus on their children and 
grandchildren. His love for children extends outward into the 
community, where he is actively involved in children's charities, 
including the Children's Museum of Cleveland and the Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation Golf Tournament.
  Mr. Speaker and colleagues, please join me in honor and recognition 
of Salvatore J. Chilia, upon this worthy tribute by the State of Israel 
Bonds, for his outstanding service on behalf of the workers of our 
Cleveland community and beyond. His work continues to serve as a shield 
of strength, protecting the heart of our nation--the American worker.
