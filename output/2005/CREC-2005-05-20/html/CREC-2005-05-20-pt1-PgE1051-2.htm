 INTRODUCING A BILL TO POSTPONE THE 2005 ROUND OF DEFENSE BASE CLOSURE 
                            AND REALIGNMENT

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. RON PAUL

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. PAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a bill to postpone 
the 2005 round of military base closure and realignment. This bill 
would postpone the conclusion of the Realignment report issued by the 
Department of Defense on 13 May 2005, as well as any preceding or 
subsequent plans that may ultimately be enacted to close or realign 
military bases on U.S. territory. This bill will postpone such closures 
and realignments until a specific set of criteria have been fulfilled, 
including until both the Defense Department and Congress have had the 
opportunity to fully study the recommendations and their implications 
for the national security and defense of the United States.
  This round of base closure and realignment also should not go forward 
while we have hundreds of thousands of troops deployed overseas in 
major conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The constant rotation of 
troops and other personnel to these major theaters of operations has 
caused great disruption, logistical strain, and terrible burdens on our 
servicemembers, their families, and the military itself.
  Also, we should not proceed with this round of base closures and 
realignments before the 2006 release of the Quadrennial Defense Review. 
Congress must have ample time to study the recommendations of the QDR 
before agreeing on any major closure and realignment strategy. To do 
otherwise just does not make any sense.
  Mr. Speaker, for these and other reasons I feel it is essential--for 
the strength of our military, the effectiveness of our defense, and the 
security of all Americans--that we postpone this round of BRAC closings 
until we are able to satisfy the critical criteria outlined in this 
bill. I hope my colleagues will join me by supporting this legislation 
and I hope for its speedy consideration on the House Floor.

                          ____________________
