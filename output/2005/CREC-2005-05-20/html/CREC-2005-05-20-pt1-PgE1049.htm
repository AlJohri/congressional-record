                           HIGH SCHOOL REFORM

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, on May 17, 2005, during a Committee on 
Education and the Workforce hearing on High School Reform I gave the 
following statement:

       I am pleased we will today hear from the Governors of 
     Massachusetts and Iowa on what measures they have found 
     useful in reforming high schools in their own states. I am 
     especially pleased that Governor Vilsack has highlighted the 
     importance of vocational education and its role in high 
     schools. High school reform is an important piece of the 
     puzzle ensuring that our nation's young adults are able to 
     succeed in their chosen career path. The goal of high schools 
     should be to prepare students for the next step in their 
     lives, whether that be continuing on to college or beginning 
     a vocational training program.
       First, we must work to ensure that students graduate from 
     high school. Recent statistics reported by the Harvard Civil 
     Rights Project show that only 68 percent of students who 
     entered the 9th grade graduated in the 12th grade. Minority 
     students were even less likely to graduate. In today's 
     economy, a high school diploma has increasingly become a 
     minimum requirement for workers. We must address issues that 
     keep students from graduating and get diplomas in their 
     hands.
       Students, regardless of background, should also know the 
     options they have after graduation. The knowledge of training 
     programs, entry requirements for universities, and financial 
     aid options is invaluable for both students and their 
     parents. Course work must effectively engage and challenge 
     students, continuing their academic growth and building upon 
     their foundation of skills. Students of all levels should 
     make progress in their studies.
       Our nation is diverse and so are the students in our high 
     schools. There is no ``one size fits all'' for high schools 
     or the students in them. Reforms for high schools should both 
     recognize and employ that fact and aim to ensure that all 
     students graduate from high school and are prepared for the 
     next step in lives.
