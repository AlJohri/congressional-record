     NIGERIA'S CONTINUING PRESENCE ON CAMEROON'S BAKASSI PENINSULA

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN R. CARTER

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. CARTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to a 
continuing threat to the longstanding goal of the United States to 
diversify our energy sources. Nigeria refuses to return full sovereign 
control of the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula to Cameroon. The 
International Court of Justice has confirmed Cameroon as the rightful 
owner of this territory. However, President Obasanjo has not withdrawn 
Nigerian troops from the peninsula, despite having promised to do so by 
September 2004.
  Mr. Speaker, Nigeria's intransigence in Cameroon threatens to 
jeopardize the United States' energy security. I agree that Nigeria, 
despite its turbulent history, has been a valuable source of oil for 
the United States over the years. However, America's interests would be 
better served by Cameroon becoming another such source--a stable, 
independent source. Nigeria must return control of the Bakassi 
Peninsula to Cameroon.
