                        HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Beth 
Israel--The West Temple, in commemoration of its 50th anniversary. Beth 
Israel was organized in April 1954 by Abe Silverstein, an early 
director of the NASA Lewis Research Center and 25 founding families, to 
provide a religious center for Reform Jews living on Cleveland's west 
side. The congregation's first service, Rosh Hashanah, was on September 
27, 1954, at the First Universalist Church in North Olmsted. For the 
next three years, services were held at either the Universalist Church 
or the North Olmsted Community Club House. Following the merger with 
the West Side Jewish Center in October 1957, Beth Israel occupied the 
Center's newly completed building at 14308 Triskett Road in Ohio's 10th 
Congressional District. The building was dedicated on May 11, 1958. The 
congregation continues to worship there today.
  For its first seven years, Beth Israel was served by a succession of 
six student rabbis from Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. Among them 
was Daniel Litt who became Beth Israel's first full-time rabbi, serving 
from 1961 to 1965. The year 1965 also brought the construction of a new 
eight-room, two-story wing and the first of two Cleveland Foundation 
library grants. The library and its volunteer staff have provided 
services for the congregation as well as colleges, schools, and 
churches throughout western Cuyahoga County. By 1995, the library 
contained more than 6,000 volumes and audio-visual materials.
  Beth Israel draws its members from Cleveland's west side and western 
suburbs in Ohio's 10th Congressional District. It prides itself on its 
commitment to education and social action. Its school, staffed by 
volunteers, covers preschool through grade 12 and has more than 100 
students enrolled. Among its alumni is Sally Priesand, who went on to 
become the first woman ordained to the rabbinate in the United States 
and to serve as Beth Israel's rabbi. As an outgrowth of the temple 
Social Action Committee, Beth Israel's members found the Cleveland 
Council on Soviet Anti-Semitism. Council founder Lou Rosenberg became a 
leader in the national movement to assist Soviet Jewry. Beth Israel's 
current rabbi, Alan Lettofsky, remains active in local affairs and has 
spoken out at interfaith rallies to save local hospitals and on other 
issues of concern to the people of Ohio's 10th District.
  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recognize Beth Israel--The West Temple 
for its 50 years of service to, and a center of worship and community 
for, my Jewish constituents on Cleveland's west side and western 
suburbs. Please join me in marking this auspicious occasion.
