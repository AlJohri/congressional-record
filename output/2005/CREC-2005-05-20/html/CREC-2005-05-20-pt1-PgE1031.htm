 HONORING H.E. SUSILO BAMBANG YUDHOYONO, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF 
  INDONESIA AND COMMEMORATING HIS FIRST OFFICIAL VISIT TO THE UNITED 
                                 STATES

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DAN BURTON

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the 
first official visit to the United States by Indonesia's new President, 
the first directly elected President in that nation's history, His 
Excellency Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. President Yudhoyono is well known 
to many in the United States from his years of service in Indonesia's 
military, and as Minister of Energy and Mines. In fact, earlier in his 
career, President Yudhoyono studied for two years in the United States. 
But this first official working visit as President is a special 
occasion, and one worth marking in the United States Congress.
  Barely two months into his term, the historic and devastating 
December 26th tsunami struck off Sumatra's north and western coasts. 
President Yudhoyono traveled to the hard hit areas immediately, and 
directed his new Cabinet to take steps to do everything possible to 
expedite immediate relief and assistance. His team undertook a 
groundbreaking effort to put together a detailed recovery plan, and 
develop open, inclusive, and transparent processes for aiding the 
hardest hit communities. President Yudhoyono has followed through on 
all three commitments he made to the international donor community to 
take the necessary steps to develop processes and institutions to 
assure the world that the generous outpouring of assistance is well 
managed, free of corruption, and gets to the people who need it the 
most.
  There is no doubt that there will continue to be bumps along the road 
as Indonesia tackles the many difficult issues that arise in rebuilding 
and re-establishing communities. I remain hopeful that President 
Yudhoyono's personal commitment and leadership will keep the process 
moving forward to ensure a full recovery for all the people who 
suffered so terribly in the aftermath of the tsunami.
  I am also encouraged by many other steps President Yudhoyono has 
taken to address longstanding issues and needs, including: an 
aggressive anti-corruption agenda; a plan to address serious 
infrastructure needs that are the basis for moving forward with his 
economic agenda to reduce poverty and unemployment; as well as improved 
cooperation with the United States and others in critical areas, such 
as counter-terrorism, maritime safety and law enforcement. During his 
visit, I hope we will learn more about how cooperation in all of these 
areas will be strengthened in the near term.
  Furthermore, as the United States develops and diversifies sources of 
energy, it becomes increasingly clear that Indonesia holds enormous 
potential. Yet Indonesia's oil and gas sector is in need of additional 
investment to reverse declining production trends. The Government of 
Indonesia is keen on reinvigorating revenue streams needed to fund key 
infrastructure projects as well as health and education programs. I am 
told that U.S. companies have more than $6 billion in projects waiting 
for approval, and that there is a similar amount available for 
investment in power generation projects--an infrastructure area that 
needs immediate attention if shortages are to be avoided in the very 
near future.
  I hope President Yudhoyono's visit will help find a way to break the 
logjam on some of the policy decisions that are needed to allow these 
investments to be made. To help jumpstart the process, I would also 
encourage President Bush and his Administration to re-start and re-
invigorate the bilateral energy talks our governments and business 
partners enjoyed throughout much of the 1990s.
  It is also my sincere hope that our governments will find a way to 
reverse declining educational enrollment by Indonesian students in U.S. 
colleges and universities. One of the most effective ways to build 
bridges between our two nations is through educational exchanges, and 
at this time when Indonesia's new democratic institutions require the 
development of management and legal skills, I certainly believe that 
increasing opportunities for Indonesians to study in the United States 
should be a top priority.
  As my colleagues have heard me say many times, I believe the United 
States needs to devote more time and attention to broadening and 
expanding our relationship with Indonesia, the world's third largest 
democracy and the nation with the largest Muslim population. Increased 
cooperation and improved relationships in a wide range of areas will 
help us build a strong bridge across the Pacific, which will benefit 
and strengthen both of our countries. I look forward to the outcomes of 
President Yudhoyono's visit and to learning how we in Congress can 
reinforce and strengthen our ties.
