            SUPPORTING INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE NEA AND NEH

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. NITA M. LOWEY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this amendment and 
strongly urge its adoption.
  Our contributions to the arts and humanities are the standard by 
which our history as a society will be measured. A strong public 
commitment to the arts and humanities, along with a dedication to 
freedom, is the hallmark of great civilizations. History has shown that 
religious and political freedoms go hand in hand with greater artistic 
and literary activity, and that the societies that flourish and have a 
lasting influence on humanity are those that encourage free expression 
in all of its forms. This is a lesson that resonates with people of 
every age, background, and belief, and one we can guarantee our 
children learn.
  By sharing ideas and images from a diverse range of backgrounds and 
through many different media, the arts and humanities help to create a 
more informed citizenry. We are better prepared to meet the 
responsibilities of democracy; to ask ourselves the hard questions; to 
demand of our leaders the full answers; and to judge fairly the actual 
and potential endeavors of our country.
  Our support for the arts and humanities also has a profound impact on 
our economy. In my Congressional District, there are over 2000 arts-
related businesses, providing more than ten thousand jobs. This creates 
a substantial economic impact. In Fiscal Year 2000, for example, the 
arts industry contributed more than $92 million in revenue to 
Westchester County alone. Nationwide, the figures are even more 
impressive. The arts are a $134 billion industry sustaining nearly 5 
million jobs. While the federal government spends just over $250 
million on the NEA and NEH annually--approximately 40 cents per 
person--it collects over $10 billion in tax revenue related to the arts 
industry. NEA and NEH dollars are crucial to the arts community, 
helping them leverage more state, local, and private funds. Clearly, 
the numbers show that investment in the arts is important not only to 
our national identity, but also to our national economy.
  Mr. Speaker, we must act decisively to commit ourselves to our 
national heritage and culture, by voting to increase funding for the 
NEA and NEH. I urge my colleagues to support creativity and reflection, 
to support our economy, and to support the continued growth and 
expression of democracy in its fullest form.
