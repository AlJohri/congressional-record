                          HON. WALTER B. JONES

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute 
to George Smith. Since 2001 the TREA Senior Citizens League (TSCL) has 
been under the strong leadership of Board of Trustees Chairman George 
A. Smith. With George Smith at the helm, TSCL has gained greater 
credibility and respectability in the Congress and in the country as a 
whole. TSCL has become a significant national player on Social Security 
issues such as the Notch, Cost of Living Adjustment based on a Consumer 
Price Index for the Elderly, Mexico Totalization, and a Lock Box of 
Trust Funds, and on other issues such as drug importation. This has 
largely occurred because Chairman Smith insisted that TSCL emphasize

educating the public about senior issues. Like other TSCL Board of 
Trustees members he has served without pay.
  George A. Smith was born on October 28, 1930. He currently resides in 
San Antonio, Texas, with his wife Marie. Mr. Smith entered the U.S. 
Army in July 1948 and served an illustrious 21-year career. While on 
active military duty, Mr. Smith earned the Bronze Star, the Army 
Commendation Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster and a multitude of 
miscellaneous awards and commendations.
  Mr. Smith is a TREA (The Retired Enlisted Association) Past National 
President. As a TREA leader, he initiated and finalized the purchase of 
the first TREA National Headquarters. He has served as Chairman of the 
Past President's Advisory Council, Chairman of the TREA Memorial 
Foundation, Chairman of TREA Finance Committee, Chairman of TREA 5-Year 
Planning Committee, President of TREA Chapter 3, and Chairman of TREA 
Convention Committee.
  George Smith has an Associate Degree in Business Management from 
Metro State College in Denver, Colorado, and is retired from the 
Colorado Department of Employment where he served as the Job Service 
Director. He also worked in the area of direct sales for 
Telecommunications, and was an owner of his own precision welding 
business. He served as President of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 
3482, and as President of a local homeowners association.
  George Smith learned from his experiences in the military and private 
sector that a strong foundation has to be constructed brick by brick 
using motivational management and a team concept. At TSCL Chairman 
Smith used his management expertise to revitalize the organization. He 
developed an expanded legislative agenda of activities in Congress.
  His visionary leadership helped move TSCL forward to the status of a 
well-known and respected organization by most Members of Congress. 
During his tenure as Chairman, TSCL has become a significant national 
player on several senior issues.
  As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I am especially 
grateful for George Smith's service in the military. His advocacy for 
senior issues and for retired enlisted military will be missed when he 
steps down as TSCL Chairman later this year. Thank you George for your 
remarkable contributions and distinguished sacrifices for our country. 
You did make a difference. God bless you.
