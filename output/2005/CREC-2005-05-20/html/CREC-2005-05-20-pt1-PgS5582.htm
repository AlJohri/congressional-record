       (1) there has been considerable progress over the past 25 
     years in reducing the number and rate of alcohol-related 
     highway fatalities;
       (2) the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
     projects that fatalities in alcohol-related crashes declined 
     in 2004 for the second year in a row;
       (3) in spite of this progress, an estimated 16,654 
     Americans died in 2004, in alcohol-related crashes;
       (4) these fatalities comprise 39 percent of the annual 
     total of highway fatalities;
       (5) about 250,000 are injured each year in alcohol-related 
     crashes;
       (6) the past 2 years of decreasing alcohol-related 
     fatalities follows a 3-year increase;
       (7) drunk driving is the Nation's most frequently committed 
     violent crime;
       (8) the annual cost of alcohol-related crashes is over 
     $100,000,000,000, including $9,000,000,000 in costs to 
     employers;
       (9) a Presidential Commission on Drunk Driving in 1982 and

     commitment to preventing these deaths and injuries.
       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate 
     that, in an effort to further change the culture of alcohol 
     impaired driving on our Nation's highways, the President

     fatalities;
       (2) research shows that 77 percent of Americans think they 
     have received enough information about drinking and driving 
     and the way in which alcohol affects individual blood alcohol 
     concentration levels; and
       (3) only 28 percent of the American public can correctly

     an individual to have used insulin for a minimum period of

     qualify to operate a commercial motor vehicle in interstate 
     commerce. Any such requirement, including any requirement 
     with respect to the duration of such insulin use, shall be 
     consistent with the findings of the expert medical panel 
     reported in July 2000 in ``A Report to Congress on the 
     Feasibility of a Program to Qualify Individuals with Insulin-
     Treated Diabetes Mellitus to Operate Commercial Motor 
     Vehicles in Interstate Commerce as Directed by the 
     Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century''.

     individuals who use insulin to treat their diabetes are not 
     held to a higher standard than other qualified commercial 
     drivers, except to the extent that limited operating, 
     monitoring, or medical requirements are deemed medically 
     necessary by experts in the field of diabetes medicine.

     motor vehicles not required to hold a commercial driver's 
     license under section 31301(4) of title 49, United States 
     Code, from compliance in whole or in part with a regulation 
     issued under chapter 315 of title 49, United States Code, or 
     with regulations issued under section 31502 of that title 
     governing hours of service if the Secretary determines that 
     it is in the public interest to grant the exemption and that 
     the exemption is likely to achieve a level of safety that is 
     equivalent to, or greater than, the level of safety that 
     would be obtained in the absence of the exemption subject to 
     such conditions as the Secretary may impose. An exemption may 
     be granted for no longer than 2 years from its initial 
     approval date and may be renewed upon application to the 
     Secretary.
       (b) Authority to Revoke Exemption.--The Secretary shall 
     immediately revoke an exemption if--
       (1) the exemption has resulted in a lower level of safety 
     than was maintained before the exemption was granted; or
       (2) continuation of the exemption would not be consistent 
     with the goals and objectives of that chapter or section 
     31136, as the case may be.
       (c) Requests for Exemption.--
       (1) Interim final rule.--Not later than 180 days after the

     entity requests exemption.
       (B) The reason for which the exemption is requested.
       (C) The time period during which the requested exemption 
     would apply.
       (D) An analysis of the safety impacts the requested 
     exemption may cause.
       (E) The specific countermeasures the motor carrier or other 
     entity will undertake to ensure an equivalent or greater 
     level of safety than would be achieved absent the requested 
     exemption.
       (F) The benefits to be derived from the exemption.
       (2) Final rule.--Not later than 2 years after the date of 
     enactment of this Act, and after notice and an opportunity 
     for comment, the Secretary shall promulgate a final rule

     Register a notice explaining the request that has been filed 
     and shall give the public an opportunity to inspect the 
     safety analysis and any other relevant information known to 
     the Secretary and to comment on the request. This 
     subparagraph does not require the release of information 
     protected by law from public disclosure.
       (2) Upon granting a request.--Upon granting a request for 
     exemption, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal 
     Register the name of the motor carrier or other entity 
     granted the exemption, the provisions from which the category 
     or class of vehicles will be exempt, the effective period, 
     and all terms and conditions of the exemption.
       (3) After denying a request.--After denying a request for 
     exemption, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal 
     Register the name of the motor carrier or other entity denied 
     the exemption, the category or class of vehicles for which 
     the exemption was requested, and the reasons for such denial. 
     The Secretary may meet the requirement of this subparagraph 
     by periodically publishing in the Federal Register the names 
     of motor carriers or other entities denied exemptions, the 
     categories or classes of vehicles for which the exemption was 
     requested, and the reasons for such denials.
       (e) Applications To Be Dealt with Promptly.--The Secretary

     90 days after the filing date of such request.
       (f) Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary shall establish 
     terms and conditions for each exemption to ensure that it 
     will likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, 
     or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such 
     exemption. The Secretary shall monitor the implementation of 
     the exemption to ensure compliance with its terms and 
     conditions.
       (g) Notification of State Compliance and Enforcement 
     Personnel.--Before granting a request for exemption, the 
     Secretary shall notify State safety compliance and 
     enforcement personnel, including roadside inspectors, and the 
     public that a motor carrier or other entity will be operating 
     pursuant to an exemption and any terms and conditions that 
     will apply to the exemption.
       (h) Preemption of State Rules.--During the time period that 
     an exemption is in effect under this section, no State shall 
     enforce any law or regulation that conflicts with or is 
     inconsistent with the exemption with respect to the category 
     or class of vehicles to which the exemption applies.

     registered to operate in Mexico or Canada may operate a 
     commercial motor vehicle transporting a hazardous material in 
     commerce in the United States until the operator has 
     undergone a background records check similar to the 
     background records check required for commercial motor 
     vehicle operators licensed in the United States to transport 
     hazardous materials in commerce.
       (2) Definitions.--In this subsection:
       (A) Hazardous materials.--The term ``hazardous material'' 
     has the meaning given that term in section 5102(2) of title

     Security for Transportation Security shall develop and 
     implement a process for the notification of a hazmat employer 
     (as defined in section 5102(4) of title 49, United States 
     Code), if appropriate considering the potential security 
     implications, designated by an applicant seeking a threat 
     assessment under part 1572 of title 49, Code of Federal 
     Regulations, if the Transportation Security Administration, 
     in an initial notification of threat assessment or a final 
     notification of threat assessment, served on the applicant 
     determines that the applicant does not meet the standards set 
     forth in section 1572.5(d) of title 49, Code of Federal 
     Regulations.
       (2) Relationship to other background records checks.--
       (A) Elimination of redundant checks.--An individual with 
     respect to whom the Transportation Security Administration--
       (i) has performed a security threat assessment under part 
     1572 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, and
       (ii) has issued a notification of no security threat under 
     section 1572.5(g) of that title,

     is deemed to have met the requirements of any other 
     background check that is equivalent to, or

[[Page S5702]]

     less stringent than, the background check performed under 
     section 5103a of title 49, United States Code, that is 
     required for purposes of any Federal law applicable to 
     transportation workers.
       (B) Determination by assistant secretary.--Within 30 days 
     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Assistant 
     Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security

     assessment requirements applicable to transportation workers 
     under Federal law to which subparagraph (A) applies.

     transportation workers initiated after the date of enactment 
     of this Act.
       (c) Appeals Process for More Stringent State Procedures.--
     If a State establishes standards for applicants for a 
     hazardous materials endorsement to a commercial driver's 
     license that, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland 
     Security, are more stringent than the standards set forth in 
     section 1572.5(d) of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, 
     then the State shall also provide an appeals process similar 
     to the process provided under section 1572.141 of title 49, 
     Code of Federal Regulations, by which an applicant denied a 
     hazardous materials endorsement to a commercial driver's 
     license by that State may appeal that denial in a manner 
     substantially similar to, and to the same extent as, an 
     individual who received an initial notification of threat 
     assessment under part 1572 of that title.
       (d) Clarification of Term Defined in Regulations.--The term 
     ``severe transportation security incident'', as defined in 
     section 1572.3 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, does 
     not include a work stoppage or other nonviolent employee-
     related action resulting from an employer-employee dispute.

     Secretary of Homeland Security shall modify the definition of 
     that term to reflect the preceding sentence.

     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the

     the implementation of fingerprint-based security threat 
     assessments and the adequacy of fingerprinting locations,
