                               of alabama

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. EVERETT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to 
recognize the completion and grand opening of Hyundai Motor Company's 
first U.S. automotive assembly and manufacturing plant on May 20th in 
Montgomery, Alabama.
  Hyundai broke ground on its $1.1 billion Alabama facility in April 
2002. When Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama reaches peak production, 
it will employ approximately 2,000 people and produce 300,000 vehicles 
per year. Hyundai's in-state suppliers will provide another 4,500 jobs 
and invest more than $500 million in the local economy.
  This plant is the most advanced automobile manufacturing facility in 
the world, using state of the art robotics and other technologies. 
Hyundai is truly creating quality jobs and quality products in Alabama.
  I am proud to welcome Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama to our 
Montgomery area and look forward to the job opportunities it will 
provide for our motivated workforce from central Alabama to the 
Wiregrass.
  I would like to applaud Hyundai for its commitment to building 
quality products, and its confidence in the great state of Alabama to 
continue that tradition.

                          ____________________
