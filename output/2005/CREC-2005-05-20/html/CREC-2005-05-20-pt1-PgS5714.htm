          MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 1084 AND S. 1085

  Mr. CORNYN. I understand there are two bills at the desk that are due 
for a second reading. I ask unanimous consent they be read for a second 
time en bloc.
  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The 
clerk will report.
  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 1084) to eliminate child poverty, and for other 
     purposes.
       A bill (S. 1085) to provide for paid sick leave to ensure 
     that Americans can address their own health needs and the 
     health needs of their families.

  Mr. CORNYN. In order to place the bills on the calendar under the 
provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceeding, en bloc.
  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bills will be 
placed on the calendar.

                          ____________________
