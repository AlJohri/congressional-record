                       HONORING MISS JEAN CORNELL

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ROBERT E. ANDREWS

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an exceptional young 
lady, Jean Katherine Elizabeth Cornell. Miss Cornell is a resident of 
Mt. Laurel, New Jersey in my district, and is currently in the seventh 
grade at Harrington Middle School. She is a member of the school's 
Student Council, and a talented singer in the First United Methodist 
Church of Moorestown's Youth Choir. Above all, she is a motivated and 
inspired young lady who is standing up for equal rights for all women.
  Miss Cornell has been involved in the Alice Paul Institute's 
Leadership Program, and helped start the Alice Paul Institute Girls' 
Advisory Council. She is very active in her community, spreading Alice 
Paul's message of leadership and equality. She is helping to build 
support for the Equal Right Amendment by educating the public about 
this vital piece of legislation. This amendment to the Constitution 
would guarantee the equality of rights under the law for all persons 
regardless of gender.
  Mr. Speaker, I applaud Miss Cornell for her contributions to her 
community, and to women everywhere. Her efforts are much needed in the 
struggle to close the equality gap between men and women. If there were 
more girls like Jean, our Nation would be a more just and equal 
society.
