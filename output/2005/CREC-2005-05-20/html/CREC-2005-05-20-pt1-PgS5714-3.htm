                                PROGRAM

  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on Monday, the Senate will resume 
consideration of the nomination of Priscilla Owen to serve as a circuit 
judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Monday will be the fourth 
consecutive day the Senate considers the Owen nomination.
  Over the past 3 days, a number of Members, on both sides of the 
aisle, have come to the floor to speak on the nomination. We have 
conducted over 25 hours of debate, and we will continue on Monday. 
Moments ago, we filed a cloture motion on the nomination, and that will 
ripen on Tuesday of next week.
  On behalf of the majority leader, I remind my colleagues the leader 
has announced our next rollcall vote will occur Monday afternoon at 
5:30. That vote will be on a motion to instruct the Sergeant at Arms to 
request Senators' attendance. Senator Frist will have more to say about 
next week's session on Monday.
