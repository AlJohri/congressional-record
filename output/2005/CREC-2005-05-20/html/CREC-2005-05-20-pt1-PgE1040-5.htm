  Mr. GORDON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 190th year of 
existence of the Hurricane Baptist Church of Lebanon, Tennessee. The 
congregation will celebrate the church's anniversary on Sunday, May 29, 
2005, with an afternoon program.

  Founded in 1815, Hurricane Baptist Church is the fifth oldest Baptist 
church in Wilson County. Located on the edge of the Cedars of Lebanon 
State Park, the church began with about 30 members. Today, Hurricane 
Baptist Church has 190 members.
  The Hurricane Baptist Church facility was built in 1907. Since that 
time, the church has added a fellowship hall and Sunday School rooms. 
Church records dating back to 1897 were lost when clerk W.B. Edwards' 
home was destroyed by fire. Some records survived through the Baptist 
association and other sources.
  Ollie Edwards Lester, a descendent of W.B. Edwards, and Elsie Lou 
Williams Merritt are two of the surviving members among the 36 original 
members baptized in Hurricane Creek during a service in 1925. ``It's 
been a family church,'' said brother James Gordon Williams, the 38th 
pastor of Hurricane Baptist Church. Brother Williams is the fourth 
generation of his family to be a member of the church. Four generations 
of the Flatt family have also attended Hurricane Baptist Church.
  Former members, their families, old friends and new have been invited 
to join ``The Little White Church down in Cedar Forest'' on its special 
day of thanksgiving and praise. I am sure Hurricane Baptist Church will 
continue to make a positive difference in the community for the next 
190 years. I cordially congratulate the congregation and Brother 
Williams for all the good they have done.
