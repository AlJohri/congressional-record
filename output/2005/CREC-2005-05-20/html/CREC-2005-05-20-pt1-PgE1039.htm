          HONORING THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE OF MILLARD OAKLEY

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. BART GORDON

                              of tennessee

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. GORDON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
support that Livingston, Tennessee, resident Millard Oakley has shown 
his community and the education of its children. In fact, Millard is 
being honored by Volunteer State Community College as its Friend of the 
Year this weekend for his unprecedented support of the college and 
higher education.
  Millard is a lifelong resident of Livingston who prospered after 
receiving a first-rate education in the community's public school 
systems and at nearby Tennessee Technological University and Cumberland 
University School of Law. A successful attorney and businessman who 
remembers his humble beginnings, Millard recently made a significant 
contribution for capital improvements at the Livingston campus of Vol 
State. He also established the Oakley First National Foundation, which 
awards full scholarships to Overton County students attending Vol 
State, Tennessee Technological University or the Tennessee Technology 
Center.
  Millard's life is a prime example of what a good education and the 
proper motivation can do for a country boy raised in the rural hills of 
Tennessee. He has served in the Tennessee General Assembly, as the 
state's Insurance Commissioner, in the state's Constitutional 
Convention, as the Overton County Attorney and as the general counsel 
of the U.S. House of Representative's Select Committee on Small 
Business. He presently serves on the board of directors of the First 
National Banks of Tennessee in Livingston, Cookeville and Crossville, 
and of Thomas Nelson Publishers, the world's largest Bible-publishing 
company.
  I cannot count the times I have sought Millard's advice on a wide 
range of issues. He has always given me his honest opinion and wise 
counsel, and I sincerely thank him for that. Millard is a true friend 
to me, his community and the Overton County students who benefit from 
his generosity. Once again, I congratulate Millard for his unselfish 
devotion to his community and to those who seek a better life through 
education.
