                      BULGARIA--AN ALLY AND FRIEND

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JOE WILSON

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend 
the Republic of Bulgaria on its continued--and unwavering--support of 
the United States both in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am particularly 
encouraged by Bulgaria's commitment in Iraq. In defiance of great 
pressure to withdraw its troops, Bulgaria has stood shoulder-to-
shoulder with the United States in bringing freedom and democracy to 
the Iraqi people.
  One need only look to Bulgaria's past to recognize the significance 
of its actions now. A former Soviet bloc country, Bulgaria was a cold 
war adversary of the United States. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, 
however, Bulgaria has revitalized its economy, entered the world 
market, and contributed to peacekeeping operations around the globe. 
Indeed, bold steps supported by a profound vision for the future, have 
resulted in great progress. Today, Bulgaria is one of the newest 
members of NATO, and it is finalizing its accession to the European 
Union.
  Perhaps the most striking illustration of Bulgaria's evolution from 
cold war adversary to strategic ally, is its willingness to actively 
promote democracy beyond its borders--particularly in Iraq. As a member 
of the United Nations Security Council during the Iraq debate, Bulgaria 
voted with the United States concerning the use of military force in 
Iraq. Bulgaria also routinely grants to the United States the use of 
its airspace, and has offered ground, air, and naval basing rights.
  Most importantly, however, Bulgaria has contributed to bringing peace 
and democracy to Iraq not only through its words, but through its 
sacrifices.
  Bulgaria has 500 troops in Iraq and has suffered 8 deaths there. Yet 
it remains resolute. On the day that two Bulgarian contractors were 
murdered in Iraq, the Bulgarian Government recommitted its support and 
later increased its troop level. The surest way to establish peace is 
to stand up to the terrorists and not turn and run, which encourages 
more terrorist barbarism.
  For Bulgaria, this is not an insignificant commitment. This Eastern 
European country is one of the least developed to contribute troops to 
the Coalition, and doing so has greatly impacted the nation's economy. 
Yet despite its limited resources, Bulgarian troops have rebuilt 
hospitals and schools, restored power and water, and provided security 
to numerous towns and villages--considerable accomplishments for a 
country that itself is a budding democracy.
  Some have belittled the Coalition as simply a reporting of numbers. 
This disparages the great sacrifices made in Iraq by smaller nations 
such as Bulgaria. To the contrary, it is the contribution of these 
smaller nations that signals to the Iraqi people that even those 
nations less fortunate than the world's superpowers care deeply about 
the future of Iraq.
  Mr. Speaker, I for one, am deeply grateful to our Bulgarian friends, 
and I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing and commending this 
United States ally for its sacrifices and continuing commitments in 
Iraq and Afghanistan. I know firsthand of this service having visited 
with Bulgarian troops in Afghanistan and my oldest son, U.S. Army 
Captain Alan Wilson, was eager to meet his Bulgarian colleagues during 
his year-long tour last fall in Iraq.
  I thank you Bulgaria for your friendship to the United States, and 
together, we will never forget the attacks of September 11th, 2001.
