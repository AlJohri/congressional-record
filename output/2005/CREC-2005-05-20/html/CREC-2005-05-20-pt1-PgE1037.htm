         HONORING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF GRACE BAPTIST CHURCH

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. BART GORDON

                              of tennessee

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. GORDON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 40th year of 
existence of the Grace Baptist Church of Alpine, Tennessee. The 
congregation will celebrate the anniversary on May 29, 2004, with a 
special service.
  Grace Baptist Church has grown from its original 25 members to more 
than 100 members today. The church serves the community through weekly 
jail ministries, bimonthly nursing home services in Livingston, 
Tennessee, and Saturday youth activities. Grace Baptist Church 
devotionals are also heard daily on the local radio station in 
Livingston.
  Grace Baptist Church supports missionaries every month, and members 
have taken mission trips to Yucatan, Mexico, and Loredo, Texas, to 
visit the missions they've supported. In fact, Pastor John Copeland has 
been to Loredo three times. ``It's amazing how God can turn lives 
around,'' Pastor Copeland has said.
  Overton County is a better place because of the work of Grace Baptist 
Church and its congregation. I am sure the church will continue to make 
a positive difference in the community for the next 40 years, as well. 
I congratulate the congregation and Pastor Copeland for all the good 
they have done. I also want to recognize one of the founding members of 
Grace Baptist Church, Bruce Ledford, who currently serves as a deacon 
there. Congratulations to you, too, Bruce for 40 years of service.
