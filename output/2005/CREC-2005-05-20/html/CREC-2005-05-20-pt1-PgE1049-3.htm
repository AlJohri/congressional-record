                       TRIBUTE TO KATIE BROWNELL

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. THOMAS M. REYNOLDS

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to 
pay tribute to 11-year-old Katie Brownell, of Genesee County, New York, 
for pitching a perfect Little League game on May 14th. This is a 
terrific accomplishment and Katie has much to be proud of, as do her 
family and her community.
  Katie, the only female player in the league, displayed tremendous 
ability as she pitched the perfect game, striking out every single 
batter she faced, allowing not even a single baserunner.
  This is not the first time Katie has dominated a baseball game 
however. In her first appearance on the mound this season, Katie 
allowed only one hit, striking out 14 batters through five innings. 
Katie also has a batting average of .714 through the first three games 
of the season.
  Furthermore, Katie has shown tremendous sportsmanship, taking this 
accomplishment humbly and in stride. Katie has never gloated and has 
never bragged. She simply loves the game and enjoys playing it--
characteristics equally as impressive as her abilities.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that this Congress join me in honoring Katie 
Brownell, and recognize her tremendous athletic abilities and 
sportsmanship after pitching a perfect game for her Little League team.
