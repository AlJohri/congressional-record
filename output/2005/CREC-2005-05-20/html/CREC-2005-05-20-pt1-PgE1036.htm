                          HONORING MARK MORGAN

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN

                              of tennessee

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to honor Mark Morgan of 
Laurel, Mississippi today. Mark was returning home one evening when he 
passed a vehicle that had pulled to the side of a bridge. Despite the 
dark and his own exhaustion, Mark pulled over to be sure the woman who 
sat in the car alone did not need any assistance. Little did Mark know 
he had just answered the prayers of a worried family and community.
  Louise Martin had left church to drive home; she'd become confused 
and lost. Eventually her car ran out of gas, leaving her stranded along 
a rarely traveled stretch of highway. After Mark stopped, he called 
Mrs. Martin's family and told them he was going to bring her home. 
Nearly twelve hours after Mrs. Martin left her church, she was reunited 
with her husband and family.
  Mr. Speaker, Mark Morgan is a shining example of the spirit of 
concern and the willingness to aid others.
