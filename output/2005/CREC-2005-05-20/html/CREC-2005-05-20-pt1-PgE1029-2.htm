                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. GILLMOR. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to pay special 
tribute to an outstanding young man from Ohio's Fifth Congressional 
District. I am happy to announce that Dustin A. Nedolast of Fostoria, 
Ohio has been offered an appointment to attend the United States Air 
Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
  Dustin's offer of appointment poises him to attend the United States 
Air Force Academy this fall with the incoming cadet class of 2009. 
Attending one of our nation's military academies is an invaluable 
experience that offers a world-class education and demands the very 
best that these young men and women have to offer. Truly, it is one of 
the most challenging and rewarding undertakings of their lives.
  Dustin brings an enormous amount of leadership, service, and 
dedication to the incoming class of Air Force cadets. While attending 
Saint Wendelin Catholic High School in Fostoria, Ohio, Dustin has 
attained a 3.8 grade point average which places him near the top of his 
class. While a gifted athlete, Dustin has maintained the highest 
standards of excellence in his academics. Dustin has been a member of 
the National Honor Society, earned scholastic First Honors for four 
years, and has earned awards and accolades as a scholar and an athlete.
  Outside the classroom, Dustin has distinguished himself as an 
excellent student-athlete. On the fields of competition, Dustin has 
earned letters in Varsity Wrestling, Football and Baseball. Dustin has 
served as class representative during his junior year in high school as 
well as Senior Class President. Dustin's dedication and service to the 
community and his peers has proven his ability to excel among the 
leaders at the Air Force Academy. I have no doubt that Dustin will take 
the lessons of his student leadership with him to Colorado Springs.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dustin 
A. Nedolast on his appointment to the United States Air Force Academy 
in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Our service academies offer the finest 
military training and education available anywhere in the world. I am 
sure that Dustin will do very well during his career at the Air Force 
Academy and I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing him well as he 
begins his service to the nation.
