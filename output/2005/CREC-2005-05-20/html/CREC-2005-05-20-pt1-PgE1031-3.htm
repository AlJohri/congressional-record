                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 761st Tank 
Battalion of World War II. On November 8, 1944 the men of the 761st 
became the first all black infantry unit to see combat. They 
successfully overtook the towns of Moyenvic and Vic-sur-Seile, which 
were occupied by German forces.
  ``Come Out Fighting,'' was the motto of the 761st also known as the 
Black Panthers. Their motto personified their tremendous sacrifice and 
selflessness in defeating the German army in World War II.
  For 183 days, the Black Panthers fought four major engagements across 
six European nations. Their courageous effort contributed to the 
overtaking of Tillet, Belgium, a German occupied area that no other 
armed force could successfully take. The Black Panthers also penetrated 
the Seigfried Line allowing the 4th Armored Division to cross the Rhine 
River.
  On May 6, 1945, as the easternmost Americans, the 761st ended their 
combat mission with a rendezvous with the First Ukrainian Army at the 
Steye River in Austria. The Black Panthers were the first Americans to 
meet the Russian Army.
  In 1978, the Black Panthers were awarded a Presidential Unit 
Citation, 33 years after the war ended. Their recognition was long 
overdue.
  Their tremendous sacrifices and sense of duty proved to be 
indispensable to the Allied Forces' war effort against the Axis powers. 
It gives me great pleasure to rise and join with my congressional 
colleagues in recognition of this elite battalion.
