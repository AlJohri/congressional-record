 SUPPORTING THE FIRST ANNUAL ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HIV/AIDS AWARENESS 
                                  DAY

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. MADELEINE Z. BORDALLO

                                of guam

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the First 
Annual Asian Pacific American HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. As Chair of the 
Health Task Force for the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, 
and as the Delegate from Guam, which ranks fourth in the Pacific Region 
in the number of HIV/AIDS cases, I am deeply concerned about the impact 
of HIV/AIDS in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community.
  While Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders together with Native 
Americans reportedly account for approximately 1 percent of new AIDS 
cases, the true impact of HIV/AIDS on the AAPI community is not fully 
understood because of the lack of data and information as well as a 
common misperception among the health professions that AAPls are a 
healthier population than other minority groups.
  Many view the Asian American and Pacific Islander population as the 
``model minority,'' a stereotype that feeds the mistaken belief that 
AAPls are less at-risk for HIV/AIDS as other ethnic minorities. The 
reality is that AAPls are as much at-risk as other ethnic groups and in 
fact, have higher rates of many preventable diseases that are co-
factors to HIV infection such as tuberculosis and Hepatitis B. In 
addition, the reported number of HIV/AIDS cases among AAPls is 
misleading due to a lack of detailed HIV surveillance, underreporting 
and misclassification of cases. Yet, the little data that does exist, 
points to increasing HIV rates within the AAPI population.
  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate a 25 percent 
increase in the number of AAPI AIDS cases from 1999 through 2002. As 
one of the fastest growing ethnic groups, made up of over 49 
ethnicities and 100 languages and with annual growth rates among Asian 
ethnicities as high as 115 percent, effective HIV prevention and 
education programs which utilize culturally and linguistically 
appropriate strategies are urgently needed. These programs must also be 
supported at the federal level through changes in funding guidelines 
and requirements that take these factors into account.
  Pacific Island jurisdictions such as my district of Guam face 
additional challenges due to their remote location. These communities 
lack the infrastructure, capacity, equipment and training to deliver 
HIV/AIDS services. In addition, these jurisdictions lack community-
based services and support found on the mainland. Prevention, testing, 
treatment and care depends on the local public health departments, many 
of which do not have the staff or funding resources to provide more 
than basic services. As a result, a diagnosis of AIDS usually means the 
patient will need to leave the island in order to receive proper care. 
Yet some choose to remain because of cultural and familial ties, 
sacrificing proper health care. No one should have to make such a 
choice.
  Today, as we observe Asian Pacific American HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, 
we must take this opportunity to educate and motivate our communities 
to advocate for resources to support initiatives that address these 
issues. I look forward to working with the Asian American and Pacific 
Islander community in support of these efforts.
