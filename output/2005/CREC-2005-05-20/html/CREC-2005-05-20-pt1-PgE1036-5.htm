William Lewis and his brother-in-law, A.W. Casad of Trenton, New Jersey 
located Lewis' farm at the location where the city now stands. A few 
years later, in 1825, the first church congregated with others soon to 
follow.
  In 1853 the area found itself in need of a Post Office, which was 
given the name of Trenton. On May 14, 1855, Trenton, Illinois was 
established. Less than a year later, on February 16, 1856, the Village 
of Trenton was chartered with Joseph Hanke as the first mayor. A little 
over 30 years later, on September 20, 1887, Trenton was incorporated as 
a city.
  In 1955, the year of its centennial, with a population of 1,400, the 
City of Trenton was given the nickname, the ``Friendly City'', and went 
on, in 2003, to receive the Governor's Hometown Award.
  Today, the City of Trenton has grown to a city of 2,700 citizens 
under the current mayor, Robert Louis Koentz.
  Here's to the City of Trenton and all who reside there.
