                      AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE LIFE

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JOE WILSON

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, more than 86,000 men, 
women, and children currently await life-saving transplants.
  However, due to lost wages and increased medical expenses, the organ 
donation process is expensive, time consuming, and discouraging for 
many potential donors. Since so many Americans could benefit from the 
tremendous generosity of organ donors, I believe Congress should help 
make it easier for people to donate their organs.
  Today, I'm introducing the ``Living Organ Donor Tax Credit Act of 
2005,'' which will provide a one time, tax credit up to $5,000 to help 
cover non-reimbursable expenses, including lost wages, incurred by 
living organ donors.
  The National Kidney Foundation has endorsed this legislation, and I 
believe it is an effective way to encourage more Americans to serve as 
living donors. Today, I'd like to ask my colleagues to join me in 
providing tax relief to the millions of Americans who unselfishly serve 
as living organ donors.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget 
September 11th.
