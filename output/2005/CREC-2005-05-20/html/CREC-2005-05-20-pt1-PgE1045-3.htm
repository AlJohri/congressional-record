                         SUPPORT FOR H.R. 2057

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CORRINE BROWN

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my 
support for H.R. 2057, which disapproves of DC. Act 16-47 (the 
Terrorism Prevention in Hazardous Materials Transportation Temporary 
Act of 2005), which calls for the rerouting of hazardous materials 
around Washington, DC.
  While re-routing hazardous materials from the Capitol area of 
Washington, DC sounds well-intentioned, it only shifts the risk of that 
transportation to other neighborhoods and other modes of 
transportation. The additional switching of these cars will add to the 
congestion in the yards, and back up traffic on CSXT main lines, 
potentially affecting their entire network, including Amtrak, VRE, and 
MARC. It also means that chemical containers could be sitting for 
hours, if not days, in rail yards waiting to be moved.
  Longer transit times and distances, increased car handlings and dwell 
times are factors that tend to increase the inherent risk of 
transporting hazardous materials. This would also add significant cost 
to the shippers, and potentially disrupt the flow of commerce for those 
customers like water treatment plants, pharmaceutical companies, gas 
stations, etc.
  The Federal Government has always had the ultimate authority over 
interstate commerce. The transportation of hazardous materials is 
governed by Federal regulations as proscribed under the Hazardous 
Materials Transportation Act, which gives the authority to DOT. And it 
is important to note that the railroads are governed by the common 
carrier duty, which means we must carry what is legally tendered to 
them by law.
  Finally, the Department of Justice, the National Industrial 
Transportation League, the American Trucking Associations, the United 
Transportation Union, Norfolk Southern and others have either weighed 
in with an amicus brief in Federal Court, a letter to the STB, or a 
letter to the House Government Reform and Senate Homeland Security 
Committees.
  I call upon government at all levels to develop meaningful standards 
that improve safety and security for all modes. Rerouting freight from 
one backyard to another does not constitute meaningful standards to 
improve safety and security for any mode, and I encourage this Congress 
to promptly disapprove DC's ordinance.
