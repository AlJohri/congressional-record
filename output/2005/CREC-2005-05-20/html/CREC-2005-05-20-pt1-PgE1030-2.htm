                          HON. PAUL E. GILLMOR

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. GILLMOR. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to pay special 
tribute to an outstanding young man from Ohio's Fifth Congressional 
District. I am happy to announce that Bradley J. Marzec of Rossford, 
Ohio has been offered an appointment to attend the United States Air 
Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
  Bradley's offer of appointment poises him to attend the United States 
Air Force Academy this fall with the incoming cadet class of 2009. 
Attending one of our Nation's military academies is an invaluable 
experience that offers a world-class education and demands the very 
best that these young men and women have to offer. Truly, it is one of 
the most challenging and rewarding undertakings of their lives.
  Bradley brings an enormous amount of leadership, service, and 
dedication to the incoming class of Air Force cadets. Bradley is a 2004 
graduate of Saint Francis de Sales High School in Toledo, Ohio. While 
attending St. Francis, Bradley was an honor student in addition to 
serving as a church youth group volunteer. Since his graduation from 
St. Francis, Bradley has been preparing to attend the Academy by 
attending the Air Force Academy Preparatory School in Colorado Springs, 
Colorado.
  Outside the classroom, Bradley has distinguished himself as an 
excellent student-athlete. On the fields of competition, Bradley earned 
his Varsity letter in Wrestling where he was named team captain in his 
junior year and has been a decorated champion. Bradley's dedication and 
service to the community and his peers has proven his ability to excel 
among the leaders at the Air Force Academy. I have no doubt that 
Bradley will take the lessons of his student leadership with him to 
Colorado Springs.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Bradley 
J. Marzec on his appointment to the United States Air Force Academy in 
Colorado Springs, Colorado. Our service academies offer the finest 
military training and education available anywhere in the world. I am 
sure that Bradley will do very well during his career at the Air Force 
Academy and I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing him well as he 
begins his service to the Nation.
