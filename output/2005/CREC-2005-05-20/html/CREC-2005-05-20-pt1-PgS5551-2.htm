                                 prayer

  The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  God of second and third chances, help us to be as patient with each 
other as You are with us. Even as You forgive us when we don't deserve 
it, give us the grace to show mercy to others. As You see what we can 
become instead of who we are, infuse us with optimism so we may become 
all You want us to be.
  God, the times require wisdom and courage. Give our Senators the 
wisdom not to mortgage the future for today's ephemeral successes, but 
strengthen them to stand for what is right and good and lasting. As You 
gave Your life for us, each day make us willing to die ourselves for 
the good of the many. We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
