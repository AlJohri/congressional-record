  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jose C. Cayon 
Dieguez, an accomplished Cuban-American journalist who has dedicated 
his career to reporting on and promoting issues important to the 
Hispanic community. Mr. Cayon Dieguez is the founder of El Tiempo de 
Nuevo York, New Jersey and Miami.
  Launched in 1963, this weekly newspaper offers stories and insight 
into the lives of Hispanics throughout the United States. Mr. Cayon 
Dieguez has served as the director and guiding force behind this New 
York-based publication for the past 33 years. During that time, he has 
proven himself to be an outstanding leader and a strong voice within 
the Hispanic community. As the manager and contributing editor of the 
paper, Mr. Cayon Dieguez has become a spokesman for the causes 
important to community organizations such as the Puerto Rican Parade 
Committee, the Puerto Rican Folklore Festival, the Columbian Civic 
Center, and the Dominican Cultural Civic Center, among others. In 
addition to his work with El Tiempo de Nuevo York, New Jersey and 
Miami, he was also the editor for the first Hispanic Guide to New 
Jersey and New York.
  Mr. Cayon Dieguez is an active member of the community, who 
volunteers his time and takes on leadership roles in a multitude of 
organizations. In the past he has served as treasurer of the National 
Federation of Hispanic Owned Newspapers, vice-president of the Hispanic 
Media Council, director of art and columnist for the Diario 
Hispanoamericano,

and columnist for the weekly paper Zig Zag. He has also served on the 
board of directors for the National Association of Cuban Journalists.
  For his exemplary work, Mr. Cayon Dieguez has received numerous 
awards and accolades, including being named one of the 100 most 
outstanding Hispanic journalists by Hispanic Media 100.
  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Jose C. Cayon 
Dieguez for his impressive career accomplishments and his dedication to 
serving the Hispanic community. I applaud him for the positive impact 
he has made through his work as a journalist, and I am confident that 
he will continue to enrich the lives of those who read his publication 
in the years to come.
