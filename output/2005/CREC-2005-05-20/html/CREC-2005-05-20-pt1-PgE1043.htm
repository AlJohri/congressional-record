            THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BROWN VS. BOARD OF EDUCATION

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the historical 
decision and individuals involved in the Brown vs. Board of Education 
decision. This Supreme Court decision was one of the most significant 
decisions in the history of the United States and was an important 
impetus in the Civil Rights Movement. Those involved moved the country 
forward and opened the doors for generations of Americans that would no 
longer believe that ``separate but equal'' was a justifiable policy.
  In 1896, the Supreme Court held in Plessy vs. Ferguson that the equal 
protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment permitted separate 
facilities of equal quality for blacks and whites. It established the 
policy of ``separate but equal'' as a constitutionally acceptable 
system in this country. For the next seventy years, many parts of this 
great Nation promoted segregation in education, housing, 
transportation, and other facilities. Blacks and whites had separate 
water fountains, rode in separate railroad cars, and were educated in 
separate schools.
  For the first half of the 20th century, there were two distinct 
Americas--one black, one white. White schools had far greater 
educational resources. They receive larger portions of state budgets 
for education. Their books were current and up-to-date. Their teachers 
were paid competitive salaries. Black schools were far from equal. 
Black students were barely prepared for the educational and living 
challenges ahead of them. Black students were closed to many of the 
opportunities for advancement. Segregation proved that separate would 
be inherently unequal.
  Lawyers for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored 
People, including Thurgood Marshall, would lead a series of court cases 
challenging the constitutionality of segregated educational facilities. 
Their argument would rest on the disparities in the educational funding 
and spending, the quality of the educational systems, and the 
psychological impacts of segregated schools.
  Researchers and scholars across the Nation provided evidence of the 
harmful effects of segregation of young minds. Dr. Kenneth Clark 
demonstrated that segregated schools nurtured feelings of inferiority 
in black children. Others showed how the preparation, opportunities, 
and access of black children were severely hampered by separate 
educational facilities.
  The Supreme Court heard these arguments and agreed with the NAACP and 
its panel of experts. Separate facilities were inherently unequal. 
States must treat all its citizens equally, regardless of race. The 
value of education demanded that the opportunities available to one 
group be available to all groups.
  The ruling nonetheless would have larger import outside of education. 
It provided hope to African-Americans that they would no longer be 
treated like second class citizens. It encouraged African-American 
leaders, such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, to pursue full 
equality through the Civil Rights Movement.
  Despite considerable resistance, this Nation has moved forward in 
equalizing the educational and social opportunities of its citizens, 
but more can still be done. Public facilities are no longer separated 
based on race. The gap in educational opportunities is slowly 
narrowing. The opportunities available to minorities are increasing. We 
could do more to close the gap in education and to ensure equal 
opportunities for all.
  For today, Mr. Speaker, it is important that we reflect on the 
importance of that Brown vs. Board of Education decision. The Supreme 
Court made a wise and important decision that changed the course of 
this Nation for the next 50 years. It guaranteed to all of our citizens 
equal treatment before the law regardless of race. This was a clearly 
important event in American history. The men and women who challenged 
the policy of segregation should be commended for their deeds. They 
should have the full appreciation of this Nation.
