INTRODUCTION OF RESOLUTION CONDEMNING RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE AND URGING 
                       RESPECT FOR ALL HOLY BOOKS

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR.

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, so much of American history is defined by 
our national commitment to tolerate each others' religious differences. 
This was the wisdom behind the words of President John Kennedy, who 
reminded us that ``tolerance implies no lack of commitment to one's own 
beliefs. Rather it condemns the oppression or persecution of others.''
  I introduce this Resolution today as a reminder that we must still 
strive to condemn bigotry and religious intolerance, and recognize that 
holy books of every religion should be treated with dignity and 
respect. Our dedication to this struggle has never been more important 
than it is today, with recent events both at home and abroad. We can 
begin to fulfill this obligation with a renewed effort to continued 
education and the dispelling of stereotypes.
  For example, much of the public is not aware that the word Islam 
comes from the Arabic root word meaning ``peace'' and ``submission.'' 
Terrorism cannot be justified under any valid interpretation of the 
Islamic faith. There are an estimated 7 million Muslims in America, 
from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds. The holy book of Islam, the 
Quran, is recited by Muslims during prayer. From the Quran, Muslims 
learn valuable lessons about peace, humanity and spirituality.
  This Resolution recognizes that believers of all religions, including 
the faiths of Christianity, Judaism and Islam, should be treated with 
respect and dignity. The mistreatment of prisoners and disrespect 
toward the holy book of any religion is unacceptable and against 
civilized humanity. I am concerned as anyone that our nation would 
disparage the Quran or the Muslim religion. This Resolution therefore 
makes it clear that it is not the official policy of the U.S. 
government to disparage the Quran, Islam or any other faith. I hope 
this Resolution will help us recognize that we need to embrace the 
Muslim people and tolerance if we are truly interested in supporting 
democracy around the world.
