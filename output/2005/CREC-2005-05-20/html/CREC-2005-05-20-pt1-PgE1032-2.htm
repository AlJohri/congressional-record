                      HONORING RICHARD F. CORDELL

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DALE E. KILDEE

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an 
outstanding gentleman, Mr. Richard F. Cordell of Flushing, MI. This 
Friday, members of the Rotary Club of Flint will pay tribute to Mr. 
Cordell, as he celebrates 42 years of service as a Rotarian, and 25 
years as Executive Secretary/Treasurer of the Club.
  Born and raised in Toledo, Ohio, Dick Cordell began his long history 
of service to others by serving his country in World War II following 
his graduation from the University of Toledo. Dick piloted a B-26 as a 
member of the U.S. Air Force, earning the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. 
After the war, Dick worked as a salesman for IBM. During this time, he 
met and married Ruth, his wife of 58 years. When Symplex purchased 
Dick's division at IBM, he was transferred to Flint where he was 
appointed District Manager.
  Dick began his distinguished career with Rotary International on 
September 1, 1963. After memberships on various committees and 
participation in many projects, Dick was elected President of the Flint 
Rotary Club from 1974-1976. He also served as District Governor from 
1984-1985. Since 1980, he has operated as the Flint Club's Executive 
Secretary/Treasurer, a position he enjoys due to the constant positive 
interaction he experiences from his fellow Rotarians. In addition, Dick 
and Ruth plan to attend this year's Rotary International Convention, 
which will be their fifteenth.
  I am appreciative of Dick Cordell's many years of leadership and for 
the untold number of individuals he has assisted, both personally and 
indirectly. He truly personifies the Rotary motto: ``Service Above 
Self,'' as well as the Rotarian philosophy of truth, fairness, 
goodwill, and mutual benefit in all professional actions.
  Mr. Speaker, as a Rotary Club fellowship beneficiary, I can attest to 
the unwavering support toward the community exhibited by its members, 
and I am grateful for people such as Richard Cordell. I ask my 
colleagues in the 109th to please join me in recognizing his 
accomplishments, and wishing him the best in all his future endeavors.
