                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. KANJORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask you and my esteemed 
colleagues in the House of Representatives to pay tribute to Kristopher 
Jones of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, on the occasion of having been 
selected to receive the Great Valley Young Entrepreneur of the Year 
Award.
  As a founder of Peppperjam.com, a 6-year-old internet-based company 
established by Mr. Jones and his brother to market their grandmother's 
50-year-old jam recipes and other gourmet food products, Mr. Jones has 
demonstrated the kind of true entrepreneurial spirit for which this 
award was created.
  A bright and talented young man, Mr. Jones possesses a diverse 
background in both his education and professional pursuits.
  Kris served as an intern in my Washington office and for the 
Financial Services Committee during the summers while he was a law 
student. Upon his graduation, I hired him as my district director. We 
talked often about his interest in growing his family business, and I 
encouraged him to focus on pursuing the unique opportunities presented 
to him. Because of his deep love of Northeastern Pennsylvania, he 
promised to keep his company based in the area to help stimulate the 
local economy.
  Recently, Mr. Jones has expanded his business into e-commerce 
consulting, a new field that has helped enable him to add new jobs to 
his company and to achieve national recognition in the field of 
affiliate marketing management.
  Always one to give back to his community, Mr. Jones regularly speaks 
with college students and recent graduates about business opportunities 
that exist in Northeastern Pennsylvania, recognizing the need to be a 
good corporate citizen and community advocate.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Mr. Kristopher Jones on 
this auspicious occasion. The entrepreneurial spirit displayed by Mr. 
Jones has set a fine example for all potential young entrepreneurs and 
fledgling enterprises in Northeastern Pennsylvania.
