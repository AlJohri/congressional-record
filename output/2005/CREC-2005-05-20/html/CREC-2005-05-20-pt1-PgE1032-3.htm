                             of new mexico

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
lifetime achievements of Southwestern golf legend Gene Torres, a 
resident of the Las Vegas community in my home state of New Mexico. 
Gene spearheaded the golf program at New Mexico Highlands University 
while simultaneously winning over 80 professional tournaments and 
raising a family.
  Born in Colorado, Gene was fascinated with golf since he was a 
youngster and qualified for major tournaments in high school. Early in 
his career he set the course record of 16 under par for 52 holes at the 
University of New Mexico-North golf course. Gene interrupted his golf 
career in 1957 to join the Navy and serve his country aboard the USS 
Shangri-La. After his tour of duty with the Navy concluded, Gene 
returned home to become the premier amateur golfer in Southern Colorado 
and Northern New Mexico in the early Sixties.
  A pillar of the Las Vegas community, Gene has called New Mexico his 
home since 1962. Well-known and respected, Gene served 42 years as a 
Professor of Physical Education and manager of the New Mexico Highlands 
University golf course, which he helped design. Gene instructed 
thousands of Northern New Mexico students and started the golfteam at 
Highlands University. In the absence of golf scholarships, Gene often 
used his own money to pay the team's tournament expenses. Despite 
financial challenges, Gene's golf teams won over 60% of their matches.
  In 1970, Gene joined the PGA where he earned the title ``The Rock'', 
for his solid performance. He is said to have consistently hit one of 
the longest and straightest balls in golf. Gene won the New Mexico Open 
four years in a row, a feat no one else has accomplished to date, and 
the PGA Life Time Achievement Award. He was named the Southwest Section

Player of the Year and streets have been named after him in both 
California and Texas. In addition to his tremendous professional 
success, Gene made time to be a teacher, husband, father, grandfather 
and great-grandfather.
  Throughout his professional career Gene was diligent in promoting the 
University Golf Program at every opportunity. Wherever you saw the name 
``Gene Torres'', you would see New Mexico Highlands University right 
beside it. As a result, the New Mexico Highlands University golf course 
has been aptly named after Gene in a ceremony attended by more than 200 
people, a testament to his involvement in the Las Vegas community and 
his contribution to New Mexico.
  Mr. Speaker, Gene Torres is a model athlete and educator. He 
exemplifies the qualities that make New Mexico great: dedication to 
education, devotion to family and commitment to community. Gene Torres 
has become a legend for not only his golf ability but his selfless 
giving in the Las Vegas community. I welcome this opportunity to honor 
his lifetime achievements and am proud that he calls New Mexico his 
home.
