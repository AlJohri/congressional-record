                                SCHEDULE

  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today, the Senate will resume 
consideration of the nomination of Priscilla Owen to be a circuit judge 
for the Fifth Circuit. This will be the third consecutive day of debate 
on this well-qualified nominee. We have had a good debate on the Owen 
nomination, with a number of Members, on both sides of the aisle, 
speaking on the issue. As the majority leader announced yesterday, we 
will be seeking a unanimous consent agreement to set a time certain for 
a confirmation vote on the Owen nomination. If an objection is raised 
to a time agreement, a cloture motion will be filed later today.
  Also, as announced by the leader, there will be no rollcall votes 
today. The next rollcall vote will be on Monday, and that vote will 
likely be in relation to a motion to instruct in order to request the 
presence of absent Senators. Additional votes are possible on Monday, 
and the leader will update that schedule on Monday.

                          ____________________
