  Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Captain Benjamin T. Lyng 
for his eight years of military service and leadership to our country. 
After graduating from American University in Washington, D.C. and 
completing Georgetown University's ROTC program, Captain Lyng was 
commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army with the 
518th Maintenance Company at Fort Bliss, Texas. He served as a platoon 
leader and executive officer before he was promoted to First 
Lieutenant. With the 518th, he led a 35-soldier platoon during a six 
month deployment to Saudi Arabia during Operation Southern Watch. 
Later, he served as a Battalion Staff Officer with the First Battalion, 
First Air Defense Artillery Regiment (1-1 ADA) also at Ft. Bliss. 
Captain Lyng was promoted to Captain while deployed in Kuwait with the 
1-1 ADA.
  After graduating first in his class at the U.S. Navy Explosive 
Ordnance Disposal (EOD) School and fourth in his Officer Advanced 
Course, Lyng was commissioned to command the 764th EOD Unit based at 
Fort Carson in Colorado Springs, CO. During his command, his company 
conducted 165 EOD incidents and over 50 U.S. Secret Service details in 
support of the President, Vice President, First Lady, Vice First Lady 
and foreign heads of state without injury.
  He also commanded the 764th EOD Unit in Kandahar, Afghanistan during 
Operation Enduring Freedom, where he and his company conducted over 300 
combat EOD incidents, rendered safe over 20 improvised explosive 
devices (lED's) and improvised rocket attacks, assisted with forensic 
evidence collection for War Crimes Tribunals and provided technical 
advisory and security services for Afghanistan's first direct 
presidential election. In addition to serving his country, Captain Lyng 
also served the people of Afghanistan by collecting over 2000 pounds of 
clothing through the charity he founded, ``Children Helping Children.''
  During his command in Afghanistan, Captain Lyng earned the Bronze 
Star Medal for his exceptionally meritorious service while serving as a 
member of the combined/joint task force-76 in support of Operation 
Enduring Freedom. Captain Lyng's tactical proficiency and selfless 
commitment to mission accomplishment in a combat zone greatly 
contributed to the success of Operation Enduring Freedom.
  In addition to his Bronze Star Medal, he has also received an Army 
Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, the Armed Forces 
Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, 
the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the National Defense 
Service Medal. Captain Lyng received the Explosive Ordnance Disposal 
Badge and the Air Assault Badge.
  Mr. Speaker, I wish to honor Captain Benjamin Lyng for his 
distinguished career and his contribution to our country. Captain Lyng 
has left a legacy of leadership and service to his community. Today, I 
congratulate him on his outstanding performance and meritorious service 
to the Armed Forces of the United States and wish him well in his 
future endeavors.
