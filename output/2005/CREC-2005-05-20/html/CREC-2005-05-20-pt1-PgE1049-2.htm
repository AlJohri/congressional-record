   CENTRAL NEW JERSEY RECOGNIZES AND CELEBRATES THE CAREER OF GRETA 
                   KIERNAN OF PLAINSBORO, NEW JERSEY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. RUSH D. HOLT

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of Greta 
Kiernan, who has served the State of New Jersey in a multitude of 
capacities for more than 40 years.
  Having known Greta for a number of years, I can personally attest to 
the tremendous contributions she has made during her career as a public 
servant. From her introduction to politics as a member of the Bergen 
County Democratic Committee in 1963, Ms. Kiernan has distinguished 
herself by virtue of her exemplary leadership and commitment. She has 
served as a key aide to several members of the New Jersey State Senate 
and Assembly, a legislative liaison to New Jersey for the New York / 
New Jersey Port Authority, a principal staff member for the Low Level 
Radioactive Waste Siting Board and a principal staff member in the 
office of the Congressional Representative of the 12th District. Ms. 
Kiernan continues to build a political legacy. She was the first 
Democratic woman to serve in the New Jersey State Assembly from Bergen 
County. Elected in 1978, Ms. Kiernan represented what was then New 
Jersey's 39th District.
  A woman of political acuity, skill, and expertise, Greta Kiernan is 
also known for her loyalty and kindness. A mother of four and 
grandmother of eleven, Ms. Kiernan is an avid collector of political 
memorabilia and artifacts. Her collection includes a rare copy of the 
minutes of the 1947 New Jersey Constitutional Convention, an extensive 
treasury of books on the political history of New Jersey (signed by 
their authors), and countless buttons, bumper stickers, and hats. Her 
wit and quiet charm are boundless, and she has earned the trust and 
admiration of so many.
  Greta Kiernan roles have ranged the gamut of public service, but her 
values and dedication have remained constant throughout. An inspiration 
to citizens of the State of New Jersey, Greta Kiernan has contributed 
significantly to the life of her community. She has earned our 
heartfelt appreciation and respect for her efforts. I ask my colleagues 
to join me in giving her this recognition.
