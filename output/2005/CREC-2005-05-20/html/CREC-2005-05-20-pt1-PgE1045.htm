            TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL MICHAEL VAN RASSEN

                                 ______
                                 

                    HON. ROBERT E. (BUD) CRAMER, JR.

                               of alabama

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lieutenant Colonel 
Michael Van Rassen upon his retirement from the U.S. Army after more 
than 20 years of outstanding service to our country. After his 
retirement on August 31, 2005, Lieutenant Colonel Van Rassen will 
reside in my Congressional district.
  Lieutenant Colonel Van Rassen has been assigned to several key 
military positions throughout his career, which culminated as the 
Product Manager for Fielding and Integration for Air and Missile 
Defense Command and Control Systems (AMDCCS) Product Office in Madison, 
Alabama, a position he has held since 2002. It is in this role that 
Lieutenant Colonel Van Rassen will leave an enduring mark on the future 
of the Army.
  He was instrumental in the deployment of the Forward Area Air Defense 
Command, cross leveraging software capabilities through the Air and 
Missile Defense Planning and Control System program, designing and 
validating the critical need for the Air Defense Aerospace Management 
Cell, leading the DOD Counter-Rocket, Artillery and Mortar initiative 
for deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq.
  Lieutenant Colonel Van Rassen has distinguished himself throughout 
his military service in challenging and diverse assignments. Throughout 
his career, he has received many medals and awards for his ability to 
lead by example, encourage excellence from his peers and subordinates, 
effectively manage the Army's resources, and consistently produce 
outstanding results. I commend Lieutenant Colonel Van Rassen for his 
ability to energize a diverse staff toward a common purpose, setting 
high standards and inspiring his staff to achieve them.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of North Alabama, I congratulate 
Lieutenant Colonel Van Rassen for his 20 years of service to our 
country.
