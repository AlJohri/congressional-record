             IN RECOGNITION OF MR. CHEN SHUI-BIAN OF TAIWAN

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. RALPH M. HALL

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, a year ago, Mr. Chen Shui-bian was re-elected 
president of the Republic of China on Taiwan. On the occasion of the 
first anniversary of his second term in office, I offer my 
congratulations to President Chen and the people of Taiwan.
  President Chen continues to work to ensure Taiwan's democracy and 
freedom, and seeks reconciliation and cooperation with Taiwan's 
opposition party leaders. He also is leading Taiwan's efforts to gain 
membership in the World Health Organization and other international 
organizations. Without membership or observership in the World Health 
Organization, Taiwan is literally an orphan in the world health arena.
  I am pleased that our government has come out strongly in support of 
Taiwan's bid for World Health Assembly observership this May.
  As we join our friends in Taiwan in celebrating President Chen's 
anniversary, we also recognize Taiwan's steps toward democratization. 
These include Taiwan's end of martial law in 1987, first direct 
presidential election in 1996, first change of governing party in 2000 
and first national referendum in 2004. Taiwan's example is encouraging 
to all those who seek and support freedom and democracy around the 
world.
