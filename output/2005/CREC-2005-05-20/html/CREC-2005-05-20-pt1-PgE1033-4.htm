                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my 
sadness regarding the recent passing of a leader in our community, 
Lourminia Carino Sen, known to all as ``Mimi.''
  A 37-year resident of Davis, California, Mimi was born and raised in 
the Philippines where she received a bachelor's degree in food 
technology from the University of the Philippines. She also earned a 
bachelor's degree in food science, a master's degree from Oregon State 
University--where she met her husband, Arun--and a Ph.D. in 
agricultural chemistry and biochemistry from the University of 
California, Davis, where she was a National Institutes of Health Pre-
doctoral Fellow.
  Mimi had an illustrious career conducting research at UC Davis. In 
1991 she began her service, working at the State of California 
Department of Food and Agriculture's Center for Analytical Chemistry. 
In 1996, CDFA Secretary Ann Veneman presented her with the Outstanding 
Performance Award for her efficient management of the laboratory. In 
2001, Governor Gray Davis appointed Mimi as the Agricultural and 
Environmental Science Advisor to the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture; she was the first person to be appointed to this position.
  Mimi dedicated her life to her family and the community of Davis. 
While raising her two daughters, she was active in the Davis School 
Arts Foundation, serving as president from 1987-88. She was active in 
Girl Scouts, Davis Ballet, the Davis Art Center and Habitat for 
Humanity. However, her most extensive volunteer work was on the board 
of the International House of Davis. Starting in 1986, she chaired the 
Philippines conference and eventually became vice president in charge 
of programs. An excellent cook, Mimi initiated the ethnic and 
Thanksgiving dinners that brought people together from all over the 
world. During that period she also cochaired a China conference, Japan 
conference, Sunday brunches and international teas. Over the years the 
Sen family hosted more than 40 foreign exchange students. Mimi's 
volunteer work at I-House led to her being honored with the city's 
Brinley Award for outstanding contributions to an organization.
  Mr. Speaker, Mimi's dedication to others inspires us all. In her 
personal life, her volunteer life and her professional life, Mimi Sen 
was continually promoting respect and appreciation for all peoples and 
cultures. It is appropriate that we celebrate and honor her life. Mimi 
will be missed in our community but her dedication to international 
relations and her life example will be cherished forever.
