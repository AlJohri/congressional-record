                   TRIBUTE TO HONORABLE RICHARD BYRD

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. W. TODD AKIN

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 19, 2005

  Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to draw the attention of the 
House to the passing of my friend and one of Missouri's finest elected 
officials, the Honorable Richard Byrd. Richard Byrd was known for his 
ready helping hand and his deep commitment to the people he 
represented.
  Returning home last Saturday, the day after the first half of the 
96th Session of the Missouri General Assembly was completed, 
Representative Byrd collapsed of an apparent heart attack after 
carrying his suitcase into his home. A friend to many, his death was a 
shock to all who knew him.
  Richard Byrd received his JD from Washington University Law School 
and practiced commercial litigation law while serving as a Kirkwood, 
Missouri city councilman from 1994-2000. He served in the Missouri 
State House representing the Kirkwood area since 2000, where he made 
his mark by always listening both to colleagues and constituents, by 
his consistent willingness to help draft bills and amendments, and by 
explaining the legal ramifications of complex legislative proposals.
  Richard Byrd worked hard to the very end. He was known for burning 
the midnight oil, always happy to help those who came to him for 
advice, and had a quick eye for detail. He had the ability to influence 
those around him and when he spoke, others listened and respected what 
he had to say.
  A man involved in his community, he served on the St. Louis County 
Charter Commission, on the board of directors of the Missouri and St. 
Louis Easter Seals organizations, and assistant district commissioner 
of the St. Louis Area Boy Scouts. He was a member of the Kirkwood 
Rotary, Chamber of Commerce and coached soccer at St. Genevieve DuBois 
Catholic Church.
  We extend our deepest condolences to his lovely wife, Moira, and 
their children Richard and Eleanor. We are also thankful for his life--
a life of service well-lived. Richard, you will be missed.
