  Mr. KANJORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask you and my esteemed 
colleagues in the House of Representatives to pay tribute to my good 
friend Master Sergeant Victor J. Luksic, of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania,

  As chairman of that Council, Master Sergeant Luksic was charged with

  Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Master Sergeant Luksic

and to the United States of America's defense has helped make this 
great Nation a safer place and has furthered the noble causes of 
promoting liberty and democracy.
