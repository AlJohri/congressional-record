                    ENDING THE CONGRESSIONAL PENSION

  (Mr. COFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, today I'm introducing legislation to put an 
end to the defined benefit retirement plan currently available to 
Members of Congress.
  These are extremely difficult economic times. We are in a debt crisis 
that will require sacrifices on the part of all Americans. I served in 
both the U.S. Army and Marine Corps, and I was taught that leaders 
should never ask others to do anything that they themselves would be 
unwilling to do. Congress needs to set an example and lead the way for 
the country. I think ending the congressional pension system is a good 
start.
  My legislation will honor any retirement benefits accrued prior to 
the passage of this bill and will keep Social Security and the Thrift 
Savings Plan in place for Members of Congress.
  I believe that Members of Congress should feel the same economic 
pressures the rest of society does, and I firmly believe that the 
current effort to reduce spending and constrain the size and scope of 
government requires that all possible solutions be taken, including 
cuts to the congressional budget.
  I urge the passage of this bill.
