    IN RECOGNITION OF THE MERCER COUNTY GOLDEN EAGLES FOOTBALL TEAM

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CHERI BUSTOS

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, January 23, 2013

  Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
results achieved by the Mercer County Golden Eagles against the Alhoff 
Crusaders in the 2A Illinois state football championship game this past 
month.
  The game was a defensive battle with both sides tied at 7 in the 
second half. During the third quarter Mercer County linebacker Devin 
Morford recovered a fumble at his own five yard line, and returned it 
95 yards for the game winning touchdown. It was the type of moment that 
seemed as if it was straight from a movie!
  I congratulate the Golden Eagles for winning the Illinois 2A state 
championship. This hard fought victory by Mercer County gives the 
school its fourth state title. The school and the entire community 
should be very proud to see such a hard earned trophy added to their 
case.
  Mr. Speaker, I am extremely proud of the accomplishments of the 
Mercer County football team, both on and off the field, and I am 
honored to salute them today.

                          ____________________
