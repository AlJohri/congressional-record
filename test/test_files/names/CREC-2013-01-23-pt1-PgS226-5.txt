 MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME EN BLOC--S. 81, S. 82, S. 83, AND S. 124

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am told there are four bills at the desk, 
and I ask for their first reading en bloc.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the titles of the bills en 
bloc.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 81) to provide guidance and priorities for 
     Federal Government obligations in the event that the debt 
     limit is reached.
       A bill (S. 82) to provide that any executive action 
     infringing on the Second Amendment has no force or effect, 
     and to prohibit the use of funds for certain purposes.
       A bill (S. 83) to provide for continuing operations of 
     Government in a fiscally responsible manner.
       A bill (S. 124) to provide that Members of Congress may not 
     receive pay after October 1 of any fiscal year in which 
     Congress has not approved a concurrent resolution on the 
     budget and passed the regular appropriations bills.

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading en bloc, and 
I object to my own request on all four of these measures.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
  The bills will be read for the second time on the next legislative 
day.
