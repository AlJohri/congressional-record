                           JACKSON, MISSOURI

<bullet> Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Jackson, 
MO, as it celebrates its 200th anniversary in 2014. Jackson is a proud 
community with a long history of hard work and an unmistakable spirit 
of community.
  Founded in 1814, Jackson is the county seat of Cape Girardeau County 
in southeast Missouri. With only 300 residents at its founding, the 
town still supported five stores, two shoemakers, and a tannery--a 
thriving hub for the time. Jackson's growth has been slow and steady, 
but stable. Today, nearly 14,000 people live and work in Jackson.
  As it embarks on its 200th year, Jackson is one of the fastest 
growing communities in Missouri. Its city slogan, `The City of 
Beautiful Homes, Churches, and Schools,' aptly represents a community 
committed to progress and improvement. In 2009, Money Magazine named 
Jackson 59th on its list of best small towns in the United States. With 
the many thousands of small towns across our country, this is a 
considerable distinction--although, to be sure, Jackson is worthy of a 
spot much higher.
  Jackson's small town feel makes it a great place to call home. The 
citizens come together for events ranging from the annual Independence 
Day celebration in the city park, to its

Homecomers event in historic uptown, to cheering for their hometown 
teams under the Friday night lights of football games. There are 
numerous other activities to keep Jackson residents busy; building 
families and friendships is at the core of each.
  The city of Jackson's officials and citizens should take pride in the 
core values of the community they call home on its 200th anniversary. 
Please join me in saluting Jackson, MO, as it celebrates this 
milestone.<bullet>
