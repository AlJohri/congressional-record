        RECOGNIZING JANUARY AS HUMAN TRAFFICKING AWARENESS MONTH

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. LOIS FRANKEL

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, January 17, 2014

  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
January as Human Trafficking Awareness Month. Human trafficking is 
modern-day slavery. Although some may think that this only happens in 
dark, remote corners of the world, human trafficking happens in our own 
backyard. The sickening fact is that it is a big, booming business--
trafficking a child for sex is often more lucrative than drug 
trafficking. This horrific crime can happen to anyone--girl, boy, rich, 
poor, U.S. citizen or not. We must work harder to protect our sons and 
daughters, leveraging community resources to find and rehabilitate 
victims and prosecute traffickers to the fullest extent of the law. In 
honor of Human Trafficking Awareness Month, I would like to thank all 
of the dedicated community advocates in south Florida including Palm 
Beach County District Attorney Dave Aronberg, and the Junior Leagues of 
the Palm Beaches and of Broward County. I would also like to thank 
Katariina Rosenblatt--a courageous south Florida survivor of human 
trafficking who uses her experience to help other victims get their 
lives back. I look forward to working with all of them to protect 
victims in Florida and around the world.
