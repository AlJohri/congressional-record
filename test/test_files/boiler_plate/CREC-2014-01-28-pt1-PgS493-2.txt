                                 prayer

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, You are always right, just, and fair. We sing of Your 
steadfast love and proclaim Your faithfulness to all generations. 
Today, inspire our lawmakers to walk in the light of Your countenance. 
Abide with them so that they will not be brought to grief but will 
avoid the pitfalls that lead to ruin. Lord, empower them to glorify You 
in all they think, say, and do as they remember that all they have and 
are is a gift from You. This is the day that You have made. We will 
rejoice and be glad in You, the source of our hope and joy.
  We pray in Your holy Name. Amen.
